## Terrain
.pull-left[
### What is terrain

> *An area of land, when considering its natural features. - Cambridge Dictionary*

* Continually varying surface
  * What varies (for us) is elevation
  
### What is terrain analysis

* calculating from the elevations and their spatial structure derived informations
  * Slope
  * Aspect
  * Curvature
  * Land forms
  * Cost Surfaces
  * Visibility
  * ...

## DEM (Digital Elevation Model)

.pull-left[
* DEM: a computer based representation of the terrain as elevation data 
* Mostly available as raster data, sometimes as TIN
* large scale: Mostly from remote (satellite) data
* small scale: areal photography or measurements, or even ground based surveys
* methods
  * Radar
  * LiDAR
  * Structure from motion
  * ...

DEM can come in EPSG 4326 (WGS 84 lat/lng).

Then might be necessary to reproject the DEM to a projected (meter based) CRS. We cover this in the next session...

## DEM Sources

.pull-left[
* depends on your region and scale
* GMTED2010 (https://topotools.cr.usgs.gov/gmted_viewer/viewer.htm) 7.5 arc second resolution (~ 225 m along the equator)
* SRTM (e.g. http://dwtkns.com/srtm) 3 arc second resolution (~ 90 meters along the equator)
* ASTER (e.g. https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/) 3 arc second resolution (~ 30 meters along the equator)
* TanDEM-X (90 m after registration, 12 m only with project submission)
* LiDAR

## Lets get some DEM

* Go to http://dwtkns.com/srtm to get some SRTM data of a location of the world of your choice
* Click on one of the tiles
* Click on 'Download GeoTIFF'
* Wait till it has finished and open it in QGIS
* Check what CRS it comes in (remember?)

## Reproject Raster

.pull-left[
* the SRTM Tile comes in EPSG 4236 (WGS 84 Lat/Lng), which is degree based and unprojected
* to work with the DEM, we have to reproject it to a meter based projection system
* (Raster Reprojection always comes with smoothing/blurring data and loss of precision!)
* which to choose depends on the location you have choosen to download
* a good choice for projected CRS is Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
* for the GIS Projection, you need to know
  * the number of the Zone you are in
  * if you are north or south of the Equator
]

## Reproject to UTM using QGIS

* I selected the SRTM tile around Switzerland
* With that, I am at 32 N(orth)
* Go to 'Raster > Projection > Transform (Reproject)'
* Select your input Raster and CRS
* Select your output CRS
  * search for in my case "utm 32N"
  * select the WGS 84 variant
* click on 'Run'
* Save your new Raster

## Slope

.pull-left[
* Identifies the slope (gradient, or rate of maximum change in z-value) from each cell of a raster surface.
* can be given in degree or in percentage

> *Conceptually, the tool **fits a plane to the z-values of a 3 x 3 cell neighborhood** around the processing or center cell. The slope value of this plane is calculated ... The lower the slope value, the flatter the terrain - ArcGIS*

## Calculating Slope in QGIS

* Go to 'Raster > Analysis > Slope'
* You could select to calculate percent instead of degree
* usually you do not need to change anything
* Click Run

.center[
![:width 48%](images/slope01.png) ![:width 48%](images/slope02.png)
]
---
## Calculating Slope Result

* The resulting slopes range between 0 and 74°
* You can change the symbology of the layer
* a good choice might be the inverse spectral color ramp
* archaeological significance:
  * flatter areas are better suited for building and agriculture

## Aspect

.pull-left[
* The aspect of terrain refers to the direction it’s facing in
* The pixels will have a value from 0-360° measured in degress from north indicating the azimuth
* Flat areas having no downslope direction are given a value of 9999.

> *Also here, the tool **fits a plane to the z-values of a 3 x 3 cell neighborhood** around the processing or center cell. Then the direction is calculated in which the plane is facing.*

## Calculating Aspect in QGIS

* Go to 'Raster > Analysis > Aspect' (Perspektive)
* You could select to calculate the trigonometric angle (n, e, s, w)
* usually you do not need to change anything
* Click Run

.center[
![:width 48%](images/aspect01.png) ![:width 48%](images/aspect02.png)
]

---
## Calculating Aspect Result

* The resulting angles range between 0 and 359.9999°
* You can change the symbology of the layer
* a good choice might be again the spectral color ramp
* archaeological significance:
  * south-facing areas (on northern hemisphere) get more sun, maybe more likely for agriculture?

## TPI
.pull-left[
* Topographic Position Index (TPI) is defined as the difference between the elevation at a cell and the average elevation in a cell that surrounds it within a predetermined radius (Weiss, 2001)
* TPI values **above zero** show locations that are **higher** than the average, e.g. ridges
* **negative TPI** values represent locations that are **lower** e.g. valleys
* TPI **values near zero** are either **flat** areas **or** areas of **constant slope**
]

.pull-right[
![](images/The-Topographic-Position-Index-Definition-after-3.png)
]

---
## Calculating TPI in QGIS

* Go to 'Raster > Analysis > Topographical Position (TPI)'
* you actually can't change anything here
* Click Run

.center[
![:width 48%](images/tpi01.png) ![:width 48%](images/tpi02.png)
]

---
## Calculating TPI Result

* The resulting angles range between ~ +/- 350 m
* You can change the symbology of the layer
* a good choice might be again the spectral color ramp
* archaeological significance:
  * ridges and peaks provide better control over areas: maybe preferred settlemen locations

## Landforms

.pull-left[
* significance of the TPI depends strongly on size of the neighborhood
* comining TPI from different neighborhood sizes reveals more 'natural' land form structures

## Calculating Landforms in QGIS

* Not available from the menue
* Open the Toolbox ![](images/toolbox_icon.png)
* Start typing 'landform', find 'Tpi based landform classification'
* Open the tool
* select the correct layer
* you can define the radii, 100 m does not make too much sense with our resolution...
* you could also define a weighting according to distance and related parameters
* **Do not now click on Run** ...this might take a while...

]

---
## Calculating Landforms Result
.pull-left[
* The calculation might take quite a while
* the result is a raster with up to 10 classes:
* a good choice might be to [download this style](data/TPIbasedLandforms.qml) and use it
* archaeological significance:
  * different classes of landscape attracts different usage
]

.pull-right[
1. Canyons, deeply incised streams
2. Midslope drainages, shallow valleys
3. Upland drainages, headwaters
4. U-shaped valleys
5. Plains
6. Open slopes
7. Upper slopes, mesas
8. Local ridges/hills in valleys
9. Midslope ridges, small hills in plains
10. Mountain tops, high ridges

## 'Basic Terrain Analysis'

* for Landforms, we actually were using another GIS within QGIS: SAGA GIS
* SAGA is a very good tool for morphometric (Terrain) Analysis
* It offers eg. a small tool that achieve all of the above and much more. It is called 'Basic terrain analysis'
* You might like to try it out
