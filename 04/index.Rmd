## Why georeferencing information is necessary?

+ Many spatial informations are already available in digital form

--

+ Archaeology often deals with legacy data (before the 1990s)

--

+ Vital information about site distribution or excavations are available only as printed maps ins books

--

+ Even for later publications, most of the time no digital data are available

--

+ For reevaluation, analysis or combining with other information, it is necessary to bring them to a GIS

---
## Things to consider

+ Every map comes with its own projection. Sometimes known, more often not

--

+ Every mapping results in errors or imprecision. Every digitalisation adds errors up to that.

--

+ Scale matters: digitised information on large scale might be precise enough, on small scale not. It is necessary to keep meta-data to know how the data were digitised (on what scale) to be able to understand on what scale they might be used.
---

# Projections
+ Every projection distorts some part of your map

---
## Things we will do today

+ Georeference a map

--

+ Digitise the information on a map

---
## Georeference a map

We use the example of the Early Bronze Age burial ground of Miskovice in the Czech Republic. General location:

50°09'26.0"N 14°32'30.0"E (Degree, Minutes, Seconds)

50.157222, 14.541667 (Decimal Degree)

https://goo.gl/maps/ZRNGjJZVchzGwbHS6

---
## How the spatial information come in the publication

+ an overview map + more detailed map of the burials
+ no information on CRS are available
+ no reference coordinates are given

![:width 45%](data/miskovice_overview.png)
![:width 45%](data/miskovice_a-d.png)
---
## Let's Get Started

1. [Click this link](data/miskovice_overview.png) and download the 'Overview' map
2. [Click this link](data/miskovice_a-d.png) and download the detailed map
3. Open QGIS
4. Start a new project
5. Add a background layer with 'manmade features', eg. positron

---
## Locate the general area

North-West of Prag

+ 50.157222, 14.541667 (Decimal Degree) EPSG 4326
+ 1618620.5, 6472956.1 (EPSG 3857)

**Check your Project CRS!**

Use EPSG 3857, as this is the native projection for our background reference map (Positron).

![:width 48%](images/positron_in_4326.png)
---
## Locate the specific mapped area

+ compare the overview map with the background reference map

![:width 48%](images/georeferencing00.png)
![:width 48%](images/georeferencing01.png)
---
## Start georeferencing

+ Open the Georeferencing Tool
+ In there, Open the raster image

![:width 32%](images/georeferencing03.png)
![:width 32%](images/georeferencing04.png)

---
## Identify and mark congruent points

+ Click on 'Add Point' in the Georeferencing tool
+ Identify in both maps points that represent the same feature
+ Click on that point in the raster image
+ In the dialog, either add known coordinates, or click on 'From map view'
+ Click in 'map view' on the corresponding point
+ Click on 'OK'
+ Repeat, until you have at least 5 points
+ **Try to spread the points over the whole image!**

![:width 32%](images/georeferencing07.png)
---
## Start the transformation (1)

.pull-left[
+ Click on 'Transfomation Settings' (the cogwheel icon)
+ Transformation types:
  + The *Linear algorithm* does not actually transform the raster. This algorithm likely won’t be sufficient if you are dealing with scanned material.
  + The *Helmert transformation* performs simple scaling and rotation transformations.
  + The *Polynomial algorithms 1-3* are among the most widely used algorithms.
  + The *Thin Plate Spline (TPS) algorithm* is useful when very low quality originals are being georeferenced.
  + The *Projective transformation* is a linear rotation and translation of coordinates.
]
.pull-right[
![:width 100%](images/georeferencing08.png)

**We use either Thin Plate Spline or Polynomial 3.**

]
---
## Start the transformation (2)

+ Define the Target CSR matching our input CSR (EPSG 3857).
+ Select the output raster file to create
+ Select 'Add to QGIS when ready'
+ Click on 'OK'
+ Test different Transformation algorithms

---
## Georeferencing the detailed map

+ Your turn:
  + Open the detailed map in the georeferencing tool
  + Georeference it based on the already georeferenced overview map
  + *Tip:* You can use the corners of the map...

![:width 48%](images/georeferencing10.png)
![:width 48%](images/georeferencing11.png)
---
## Result

.pull-left[
+ Now you should have the maps georeferenced, i.e. their orientation and extend are aligned with the reference map.
+ You can activate and deactivate the layer to compare
+ Every pixel in the map should be placed in space as best as possible
+ You can start digitising features of the map into spatial data (eg. as shapefile)

---
## Digitising Points

Now we can start recording the position of map features as spatial data. Remember the types of vector data:

+ Point
+ Line
+ Polygon

At first, we digitise the burials as points. To do so, we add a new Shapefile layer.

---
## Adding a point layer

+ Click on 'Layer > Create Layer > New Shapefile Layer'
+ As geometry type, you can select 'Point'
+ Select the storage location and name of your new layer
+ You can add more fields (of different data tye) to the shapefile layer as needed.
+ (We stick to the ID field as only field for now)
+ Click on 'OK'.

![:width 32%](images/digitising_points02.png)
![:width 32%](images/digitising_points07.png)
---
## Adding point features to a shapefile layer (1)

+ First, enable Editing Mode
+ Than, select 'Add Point Object'

![:width 48%](images/digitising_points03.png)
![:width 48%](images/digitising_points04.png)
---
## Adding point features to a shapefile layer (2)

+ Click in the center of a burial
+ In the dialog, add the burial number as id
+ Repeat for all burials...
+ Click on 'Save Changes' and on 'Switch Edit Mode' to store your changes in the file.

![:width 48%](images/digitising_points05.png)
![:width 48%](images/digitising_points06.png)
---
## Adding polygon features to a shapefile layer (1)

+ If you need to record the extend of objects, you might like to consider digitising them as polygon
+ Add new layer, select 'Polygon' as Geometry type
+ Add fields as needed, select storage location, mark name with '_polyon' or similar to know later the geometry type of that layer.

![:width 48%](images/digitising_polygon01.png)
![:width 48%](images/digitising_polygon02.png)
---
## Adding polygon features to a shapefile layer (2)

+ First, enable Editing Mode
+ Than, select 'Add Polygon Object'
+ Left click on a point of the burial border
+ Add more nodes of the polygon by left clicking on further points of the burial border
+ Right click to finish adding points

![:width 48%](images/digitising_polygon03.png)
![:width 48%](images/digitising_polygon04.png)
---
## Adding polygon features to a shapefile layer (3)

+ Repeat for all burials
+ Click on 'Save changes' and 'Switch Edit Mode'
+ Your new layer contains now the spatial information for all burials

![:width 32%](images/digitising_polygon05.png)
![:width 32%](images/digitising_polygon06.png)
![:width 32%](images/digitising_polygon07.png)
---
## Inspect the final result

+ You now can deactivate the georeferenced map to inspect the result on the background reference map
+ You can also turn on labeling to see the burial numbers
+ Now, you will have many different files in your output folder...

![:width 32%](images/digitising_polygon08.png)
![:width 32%](images/digitising_polygon09.png)
![:width 32%](images/digitising_polygon10.png)

---
## Finally

+ Now you can use your data for mapping and for further analysis
+ Keep in Mind:
  + Every mapping results in errors or imprecision. Every digitalisation adds errors up to that.
  + Scale matters: digitised information on large scale might be precise enough, on small scale not. It is necessary to keep meta-data to know how the data were digitised (on what scale) to be able to understand on what scale they might be used.
  + **Be as accurate as possible and neccesary**

### Homework
+ Select an arbitrary map from archaeological literature (individual burial ground to europe wide mapping).
+ Digitise the information (point or polygon)
+ Send me the resulting shapefile and the (georeferenced) original map.
